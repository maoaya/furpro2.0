      --all                         The opposite of `onlyChanged`. If

                                    jest with `--all` will force Jest to run all
                                    tests instead of running only tests related

                                    will prevent snapshots from being written
                                    unless explicitly requested.      [booleano]
      --clearCache                  Clears the configured Jest cache directory
                                    and then exits. Default directory can be

      --clearMocks                  Automatically clear mock calls, instances,
                                    contexts and results before every test.
                                    Equivalent to calling jest.clearAllMocks()
                                    before each test.                 [booleano]

  -c, --config                      The path to a jest config file specifying
                                    how to find and execute tests. If no rootDir
                                    is set in the config, the directory
                                    containing the config file is assumed to be
                                    the rootDir for the project. This can also
                                    be a JSON encoded value which Jest will use
                                    as configuration.     [cadena de caracteres]

                                    executing the test. If the file path matches
                                    any of the patterns, coverage information
                                    will be skipped.                     [tabla]
      --coverageProvider            Select between Babel and V8 to collect
                                    coverage          [selección: "babel", "v8"]
      --coverageReporters           A list of reporter names that Jest uses when
                                    writing coverage reports. Any istanbul
                                    reporter can be used.                [tabla]
      --coverageThreshold           A JSON string with which will be used to
                                    configure minimum threshold enforcement for
                                    coverage results      [cadena de caracteres]
      --debug                       Print debugging info about your jest config.
                                                                      [booleano]

                                    tests. After executing a test, it will try
                                    to garbage collect the global object used,
                                    and fail if it was leaked         [booleano]
      --detectOpenHandles           Print out remaining open handles preventing
                                    Jest from exiting at the end of a test run.
                                    Implies `runInBand`.              [booleano]
      --errorOnDeprecated           Make calling deprecated APIs throw helpful
                                    error messages.                   [booleano]
  -e, --expand                      Use this flag to show full diffs instead of
                                    a patch.                          [booleano]
      --filter                      Path to a module exporting a filtering
                                    function. This method receives a list of
                                    tests which can be manipulated to exclude
                                    tests from running. Especially useful when
                                    used in conjunction with a testing
                                    infrastructure to filter known broken tests.

                                    files that were passed in as arguments.
                                    Useful for pre-commit hook integration to
                                    run the minimal amount of tests necessary.
                                                                      [booleano]

                                    completed running. This is useful when
                                    resources set up by test code cannot be
                                    adequately cleaned up.            [booleano]

      --globalTeardown              The path to a module that runs after All

      --globals                     A JSON string with map of global variables
                                    that need to be available in all test
                                    environments.         [cadena de caracteres]
      --haste                       A JSON string with map of variables for the

      --ignoreProjects              Ignore the tests of the specified projects.
                                    Jest uses the attribute `displayName` in the
                                    configuration to identify each project.
                                                                         [tabla]
      --injectGlobals               Should Jest inject global variables or not

      --json                        Prints the test results in JSON. This mode
                                    will send all other test output and user
                                    messages to stderr.               [booleano]
      --lastCommit                  Run all tests affected by file changes in
                                    the last commit made. Behaves similarly to

                                    arguments and exits. Most useful in a CI
                                    system together with `--findRelatedTests` to
                                    determine the tests Jest will run based on

      --logHeapUsage                Logs the heap usage after every test. Useful
                                    to debug memory leaks. Use together with
                                    `--runInBand` and `--expose-gc` in node.
                                                                      [booleano]

      --moduleNameMapper            A JSON string with a map from regular
